<h2>More Stuff</h2>

<p>I occasionally post things <a href="https://twitter.com/izs">on twitter</a>.
I use automated blocking scripts with reckless abandon at times, usually for
justifiable reasons.  If you find that I've blocked you, let me know, and I
will typically unblock you swiftly.</p>

<p>I am very active <a href="https://github.com/isaacs">on GitHub</a>, often in
the various projects related to <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> and <a
href="https://node-tap.org/">tap</a>.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise stated, and to the greatest extent possible, everything on
this site reflects my opinions and thoughts, and not any current or former
employers, colleagues, friends, or others.  Don't hold anyone accountable for
my bad takes.</p>
